# Subscription plans

The platform offers a free plan as an entry point for new workspaces. The free
plan now behaves like a time-limited trial: its expiry is calculated from the
`SUBSCRIPTION_FREE_PLAN_PERIOD_DAYS` environment variable and is stored on the
subscription when a chat subscription is provisioned.
